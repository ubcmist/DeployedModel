# Deployed model for stress prediction

## How to run
Clone the repository onto your system, and enter the following commands:
```
cd DeployedModel
source venv/bin/activate
```
The second command above activates the virtual environment that is to contain all the dependencies for the app to run.
Then run these commands:
```
pip install -r mainApp/requirements.txt
```
This command installs the dependencies needed to run the app.
```
python mainApp/web/app.py
```
This launches the app.
